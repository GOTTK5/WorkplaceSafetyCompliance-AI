üöÄ PPE Detection System with YOLOv8
     by GOTTK5
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
üìå Overview
This project is a real-time PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) Detection System using YOLOv8. It detects whether workers are wearing essential safety gear (Helmet, Goggles, Gloves, Boots, and Vest) from various video sources, including:
Webcam (Live Feed)
YouTube Video Streams
CCTV/RTSP Streams
It features encrypted code protection to prevent unauthorized use and copying.‚ö°

‚ú® Features
‚úÖ Real-time PPE Detection (Helmet, Goggles, Gloves, Boots, Vest)
‚úÖ Multi-Source Video Support (Webcam, YouTube, CCTV)
‚úÖ Smart Alert System (Triggers alerts after 10s if PPE is missing)
‚úÖ Encrypted Code Protection (To prevent unauthorized copying)
‚úÖ Non-Blocking Alerts (Pop-up & Beep Sound)
‚úÖ Customizable & Expandable

üîß Installation & Setup
1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure Python and pip are installed, then run:
pip install ultralytics opencv-python numpy pillow yt-dlp
2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone This Repository

git clone <https://github.com/GOTTK5/WorkplaceSafetyCompliance-AI.git>
cd WORKPLACE-SAFETY-COMPLIANCE

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Script
1. For IMAGE PPE DETECTION :: ( detects PPE in an image without any alert message)
1_imgdet.py                      
2.üé• For BASIC YouTube Stream PPE DETECTION ::( detects PPE from a youtube video without any alert message)
Edit VIDEO_SOURCE in the script:
VIDEO_SOURCE = "https://youtu.be/YOUR_VIDEO_LINK" 
or simply run
Run:
2_basicyt.py                      
3.FOR WEBCAMERA ONLY PPE DETECTION :: (no alert only detection)
3_basicweb.py                 
4.FOR GOGGLES DETECTION AND ALERT::( only gives alert for goggles. This is for testing if you only have goggles or specs not for  other PPE‚Äôs )
4_goggalert.py                 
5.FOR WEBCAM DETECTION ALONG WITH ALERT::( PEE detection along with alert on web camera )
5_webcam.py                   
6.üì° FOR CCTV RTSP STREAM ALONG WITH ALERT :: ( For CCTV and Yt Videos along with alert  )
Edit VIDEO_SOURCE:
VIDEO_SOURCE = "rtsp://username:password@IP:PORT/stream"
Run:
6_ytandcamera.py

üõ† How It Works
1Ô∏è‚É£ The YOLOv8 model detects PPE in real-time.
2Ô∏è‚É£ If a required PPE is not detected for 10 seconds, an alert triggers (Beep + Pop-up).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Encrypted code protection prevents unauthorized copying.

üìà Model Training Details
The YOLOv8 model is trained for 100 epochs, which may lead to variations in detection accuracy. 
*Further updates and improvements will be made to enhance system performance.
